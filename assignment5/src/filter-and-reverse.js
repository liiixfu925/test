/**
 * This utility function should create a shallow copy of the reversed array,
 * filtered down to just the elements from the given array that pass the test
 * implemented by the provided callbackFn function.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *  array: The array will be a numeric array and can also be empty.
 *  callbackFn: A function to execute for each element in the array. It should
 *  return a truthy value to keep the element in the resulting array, and a falsy
 *  value otherwise. The function is called with the following
 *      arguments:
 *          element - The current element being processed in the array.
 *          index - The index of the current element being processed in the array.
 *  for example the callbackFn can filter odd or even numbers.
 *
 * @param {Array} array the array
 * @param {Function} callbackFn the callback function
 * @return {Array} the filtered and reversed array.
